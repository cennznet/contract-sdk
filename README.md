# Contract SDK
A high level API over the CENNZnet contract runtime.
Contract developers should use this SDK to access behaviour and data from the underlying blockchain.

Project goals are to provide a stable integration point for changes from Substrate
and Parity's contract eDSL (https://github.com/Robbepop/pdsl).

## Development
Intended to compile with `#![no_std]`  
Run: `cargo build`  

## Gas Costs
Associated gas costs can be found [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/srml/contract/COMPLEXITY.md)
